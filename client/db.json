The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."

According to physics, there can never be true physical nothingness—though there can be times when existence resembles nothing, such as a vacuum (the state of minimum possible energy) (Phys.org). Creating a space where there are no quantum fluctuations requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would be a remnant of that energy in that space afterwards if the fluctuations were flushed out, plus an unstable environment (1veritasium). Even on computers, deleted data is not actually tossed away, by rather written over. The fact that there can never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something has always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bang—God, the universe in infinitesimal form, or both—one thing is certain: it was there. "
